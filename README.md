# xssattack

This Python tool is designed to test web applications for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into specified URL parameters and detecting JavaScript alerts. It leverages the Selenium library for browser automation, uses webdriver-manager for ChromeDriver management, and supports concurrent execution for efficiency. Results are compiled into an HTML report and automatically opened in Firefox.
